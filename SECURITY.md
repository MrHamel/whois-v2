## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability, please email it to [me@cynthia.re](mailto:me@cynthia.re).

Please also note that since this is an open source project that I am not earning any money from, I can not provide bug bounties.
However I am happy to give you credit in the CREDITS.md file. :)
Thank you
