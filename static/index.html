        Welcome to my WHOIS client :)<br>

        Currently supported types of objects: domains, IPv4 addresses, IPv6 addresses, ASNs, AS-SETs, RIPE Handles, ARIN Handles, AfriNIC Handles, LACNIC Handles, APNIC Handles, ISNIC Handles.<br>
        If you have any issues with this service, please email me at <a href="mailto:me@cynthia.re">me@cynthia.re</a> and I will try to fix it.<br>
        If you want this in raw text form then just replace /whois/ with /whoistxt/, although this may break non ASCII characters.<br>
